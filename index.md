## Welcome to AGNET Docs

This is a basic documentation page to learn more about AGNET and for my own personal documentation of the API as it is created.

### What is AGNET?

AGNET is a foundation for the internet, in minecraft. Combined with the desktop client, webservers, and BOSS server -- it allows users to create whatever they wish!

### What is AGNET coded in?

AGNET is primarly coded in **Lua**.

### Download and Use AGNET
Here are the current resources for AGNET:
- **AGNET Desktop**: pastebin coming soon! **Github Repo**: github coming soon!
- **AGNET Boss Server**: pastebin coming soon! **Github Repo**: github coming soon!
- **AGNET Webservices**: pastebin coming soon! **Github Repo**: github coming soon!

### Deploy AGNET BOSS and Webservices
In order for the AGNET Network/Internet Service to work, the the AGNET Boss Server is required to be set up FIRST. The AGNET Boss stores user information and data about the network. ***Note: AGNET BOSS Server does NOT record passwords natively. The BOSS Server records the Computer ID the desktop/client user is currently registering with.***

If you have not already, download the AGNET BOSS Server script/client [here](#download-and-use-agnet)

Next, follow the setup on screen. The setup is easy and guides you through the whole process. The Boss server will advertise by brodcasting with the specific AGNET protocol, and will indicate it is ready to accept client connections. **The same for webservices**.
